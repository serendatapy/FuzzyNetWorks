                        I live in the Roman Countryside of Italy with my new adopted Italian family. My journey into tech begun with a degree in Artificial Intelligence, from which I took a long break to teach English, and thanks to which I now have a family. I have however always remained fascinated and interested in technology, and have continued my learning of various programming languages for the web and beyond.

                        That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
